lucre: Anonymous Electronic Tokens
==================================

What is lucre?
--------------

lucre is an implementation (in C++ and Java) of David Wagner's
Diffie-Hellman variant on Chaumian blinding. This variant is thought to be
unprotected by patents, however, you use it at your own risk.

For a detailed explanation, see [theory2.pdf][].

Where is lucre?
---------------

The lucre code is available using [git][] or as a tarball.

The tarball snapshot is autogenerated from the repository HEAD. It can be
fetched from:

<http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre/tarball/master>

The git master repository lives at:

<http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre>

to check out a working copy with git, do the following:

    git clone http://github.com/benlaurie/lucre.git

this should create a directory called `lucre`, which will contain the
current source tree. At any time, anywhere within this tree, you can type:

    git pull

to get the latest versions and keep your tree up to date.

Why is lucre?
-------------

In case you are wondering what on Earth blinding is good for, the answer is
(at least): anonymous digital money and other untraceable transactions.

What can I use lucre for?
-------------------------

You can use lucre for any purpose you desire, non-commercial or otherwise,
so long as you stick to the licencing agreement described in the file
LICENCE, distributed with the lucre source. This licence is extremely open,
reasonable and flexible, and we doubt you will have any issues with it.

If you develop a useful application using lucre, please let us know and
we'll link to it from here.

How can I support lucre?
------------------------

If you wish to to get your hands filthy, you can submit bug reports,
patches, ideas, ports, code, stimulants or anything else you care to think
of. We would more than welcome it.
